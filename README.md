# WeatherTool Project

## Disclaimers

⚠️ **This project is inspired by a university assignment but contains only my original implementation.** ⚠️
This is an incomplete version of the project and is intended for demonstration purposes only. The full code is not included due to restrictions, but if you're interested in seeing the full implementation or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at [zernishnazir@gmail.com](mailto:zernishnazir@gmail.com).


## Overview

The WeatherTool is a Java-based application designed to help users identify the current season in a specific country based on a given month. It provides functionality to map different months to the appropriate season for countries located in different hemispheres, with a focus on Australian seasons. This tool is a demonstration of my skills in modular design, method creation, and effective handling of various edge cases in programming.

## Features

- **Season Identification**: The core function `findSeason` helps determine the season in Australia based on the month input. 
- **Modular Design**: The code is structured into separate modules, each handling specific logic to ensure scalability and ease of maintenance.
- **Unit Testing**: Unit tests are included to ensure the accuracy of the logic and that edge cases are covered effectively.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates the following key skills:

- **Modular Design**: Each component of the system is designed with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend.
- **Java Programming**: The project uses core Java concepts such as methods, assertions, and modular design.
- **Testing**: Emphasizing the importance of unit tests, the project includes sample tests to validate the correctness of the application.
- **Problem Solving**: The development of a weather and season identification tool demonstrates an ability to solve practical problems with clear, simple code.

## Files

- **WeatherTool.java**: Contains the main logic for identifying the season.
- **FindSeasonTest.java**: Includes tests to validate the functionality of the `findSeason` method.
- **LICENSE**: Open-source license for this repository.
- **repo.md**: A brief description of the project (this file).

## Usage

1. Download the project files.
2. Run `WeatherTool.java` to start using the application.
3. Use the `findSeason` method to pass a country and a month to receive the corresponding season.
